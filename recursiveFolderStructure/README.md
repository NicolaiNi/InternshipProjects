# Compare two folder trees recursively

C# example to print folder structure of two folder tress to console and do different things with it. Was used in an other application to find datafiles with equal names and compare them.

* search for equal file types with the same parent folder, 
  e.g ```...\folder1\a\test.txt``` and ```...\folder2\b\a\test.txt``` and do something
* get total number of files
* get folder trees printed to console
* full access to all file parameters, parent folders and subfolders
